## Summary
This quest tasks us with creating a key fob using a the esp32 board, a transmitter, and a receiver. This key is met to interact with a hub by sending a unique ID and code which the hub then relays to a servers along with its own ID. Through a local network, the server on the RPi and a web client receive both IDs, the location and time of the interaction as well as the person. The hub then sends an unlocked signal to the fob triggering a green LED on the board. Figure 1.1 below is an illustration of a state machine for the overall system.
