## Summary
In this quest, we made a Retro Alarm Clock. The primary function of the alarm clock is to work as a timer. So when a user inputs a specific time, then our clock will take in that time and start a timer. When this timer starts, the seconds will be recorded by one of the servos. Then, the minutes will be recorded by the last two digits on the Alphanumeric display and by the second servo. The hours will be recorded by the first two digits of the alphanumeric display. 

## Design Specifications and Evaluation Criteria:
### Objective Criteria
1. Two servos indicate actual time in seconds and minutes: **Yes**
2. Alphanumeric display indicates actual time in hours and minutes: **Yes**
3. Can set time: **Yes**
4. Demo delivered at scheduled time and report submitted in team folder with all required 
5. Investigative question response: How can you synchronize multiple ESP clocks with each other?
