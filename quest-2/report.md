## Summary
This quest required the periodic measuring of IR and ultrsonic sensor in meters and the measuring of thermistor in Celsius which were then plotted in real time on canvas.js 


## Evaluation Criteria
1. Periodic measuring of ultrasonic sensor in m
2. Periodic measuring of IR sensor in m
3. Periodic measuring temperature in C
4. Results graphs at host
5. Results graphed continuously based on reporting period 
6. Investigative questions response


## Solution Design
1. Ultrasonic Range Sensor 
  -We first changed the ADC width bit size to 10
2. IR range finder
  - We first changed the attentuation to 11, and the bit size to 10. We tested the IR with a distance trail and collected the raw and voltage outputs data for the corresponding distances. Using execl, we plotted the voltage versus the distance measure and created a function to fit the curve. 
3. Thermistor
4.
